# Awesome AI

**Curated Claude Code skills for thinkers, researchers, and strategists.**

I built these skills to augment how I think, research, and make decisions. Now I'm sharing them with you.

## Why This Exists

Most AI tools give you answers. I wanted something different — tools that help me **think better**, not think less.

These skills are born from years of obsessing over:
- **Rationality** — LessWrong, CFAR, Bayesian thinking
- **Systems thinking** — feedback loops, second-order effects, leverage points
- **Strategic frameworks** — theory of change, backcasting, WOOP
- **Research methodology** — source validation, triangulation, confidence calibration

Each skill encodes a methodology I actually use. They're opinionated, thorough, and designed to produce real output — not generic advice.

## Skills

| Command | Description | Usage |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `/akorchak:deep-research` | Multi-source research with validation, source tiering (Tier 1-3), and confidence levels | `/akorchak:deep-research [topic]` |
| `/akorchak:icp-generator` | B2B Ideal Customer Profiles with 5-dimension analysis, buyer personas, and scoring model | `/akorchak:icp-generator [company]` |
| `/akorchak:strategy` | Strategic planning with goal validation, theory of change, WOOP, and phased roadmaps | `/akorchak:strategy [goal]` |
| `/akorchak:thinking-session` | Deep thinking with Socratic dialogue, rationality frameworks (CFAR), and systems thinking | `/akorchak:thinking-session` |
| `/akorchak:venture-assessment` | VC investment analysis with weighted scoring and INVESTABLE/NOT INVESTABLE verdict | `/akorchak:venture-assessment [company]` |

## Installation

```bash
# All commands have to be executed in Claude CLI tool
# Add marketplace
/plugin marketplace add 57uff3r/awesome-ai

# Install plugin
/plugin install akorchak-awesome-ai

# Restart Claude via /exit command 
# and all installed skills will appear in your system
```

## Philosophy

**Structured over freeform.** Every skill follows a clear methodology with defined phases and outputs.

**Rigorous over convenient.** Deep research requires source validation. Strategy requires stress-testing assumptions. Thinking sessions challenge, not validate.

**Actionable over theoretical.** Skills produce artifacts — research reports, ICPs, strategy docs, assessment memos — not just conversations.
